## Project Overview

#### at first clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/rifat17/SeleniumQA.git

cd SeleniumQA
```

#### install dependancies

```shell
python -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirments.txt
```

#### go to project folder
```sh
cd BikroyDotComE2EWebTEST

```

#### If you want to run all tests, you should type: 

```sh
pytest 
```

#### If you want to run all tests from assignment, you should type: 
```sh
pytest BikroyDotCom/tests/tests_from_assignment.py 
or
python -m unittest BikroyDotCom/tests/tests_from_assignment.py
```


#### If you want to run just a class, you should type: 
```sh


python -m unittest BikroyDotCom/tests/test_homePO.py
```

#### If you want to run just a test method, you should type: 
```sh
python -m unittest BikroyDotCom.tests.test_homePO.Test_HomePO.test_get_copyright_text_is_not_none

```
